# Extraction and Handling of Consecutive Data and Outliers

## Description
This Python script is designed to extract consecutive data from CSV files and to identify and handle outliers within this data. The script allows the user to select a specific directory and process all CSV files in that directory to extract consecutive data and identify outliers.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need the following:
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy
- scrypt.py must be in root directory

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the script.
3. Run the script using the command: python script.py
4. Follow the instructions displayed to select the directory and process the CSV files in that directory.
5. The results of the processing, including the identification of outliers, will be saved in separate CSV files.

## Notes
- This script processes only CSV files that do not have "_outliers" in their names. Files that already have processed outlier data will not be reprocessed.
- Make sure the CSV files you want to process are in the correct format and contain valid data.
- For any issues or questions, please open an issue in this repository.
